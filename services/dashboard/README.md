# Dashboard Service
The dashboard is a nice overlay over your CMD window, that runs DCSServerBot. It displays the current status of your
servers, the number of people flying, other nodes, if you're part of a cluster and the most recent entries of your
dcssb-_node_.log file.

## Configuration
There is no configuration for the dashboard yet.

You can disable the dashboard atm in your main.yaml like so:
```yaml
use_dashboard: false  # disable the Dashboard (default: true)
```
